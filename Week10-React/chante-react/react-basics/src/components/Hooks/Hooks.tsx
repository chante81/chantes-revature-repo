/*
    Components have lifecycle methods that can be grouped together as such:

        - Initialization
            - Where the component is initially created in code, and any initial values are setup
            - props or state values
        - Mounting
            - Where the component in the React Virtual DOM is actually added and rendered to the actual DOM
        - Updation
            - Where if there are any updates to the component that need to be shown to the screen
            - Example, if someone were to change a field or name, it should reflect everywhere else
            - If a number is meant to go up and display to the screen, it should
            - This is based on if the Prop or the State of the component changes
            - State refers to any value or field in the component that when changed, will trigger a re-render
        - UnMounting
            - This is when a component is removed from the DOM and the Virtual DOM
        
        All of these stages have methods that we can intercept and override or add additional behaviors


    What is a hook?
        - Extra methods added to functional components to replicate the behavior of class components
    
    Hooks we will be using
        - useState();
            - Allows us to create state variables
            - What is State?
                - Variables that are directly tied to the rendering of the component
                - If this variable changes, then it should reflect on the display of the component

        - useEffect()
            - Used when you want something done as soon as the page or component loads in
            - Has multiple functionalities built into it, we will focus on the functionality of doing something when the page loads
